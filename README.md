# hello-world
My very first repository

Hi, dear humans !

I'm a hobbyist web developper for the moment. My actual goal is to be able to manage complex Network Systems and to create nice web and mobile interfaces to use 'em. I've already learned about HTML 5, CSS 3, JS (ES7, React), PHP 5 and 7. I'm actually learning React Native before going deep into Node, Mongo, Python and then Network Administration and Ethical Hacking with Linux.
